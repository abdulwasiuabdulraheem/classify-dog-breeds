1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg
to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Yes. The three model architectures classified the breed of dog
in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed

2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to
be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not,
report the differences in the classifications.

No. The three models  wrongly classified Dog_02.jpg and correctly classified
Dog_01.jpg

3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and
 Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Yes. The three models classified Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not
be dogs.

4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture
that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images.
Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded
image classification.

Given the result from uploaded images. The three models performed equally. They all correctly identify
images of 'dogs' and 'not-a-dog' 100% of the time. They all correctly classified
the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg but none of them correctly classified Dog_02.jpg.
